An open source interface for Trojan Finance, based in Uniswap Interface. https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-interface

## What Trojan Finance can do for you?

The Trojan Finance platform gives the user the opportunity to take trading decisions based on future transactions.
It monitors the mempool (pending transactions) and displays the most possible future result of each trade, based on Uniswap SDK.

# Accessing the Trojan Interface

To access the Trojan Interface visit [app.trojan.finance](https://app.trojan.finance).

Trojan Finance Interface is based on Uniswap Interface, we had removed features that we dont use for now, like Pools, Votes, Staking, V1 Trades.

We are publishing our interface code very soon so **users can check it and trust that we follow the same way Uniswap works with wallets, in a secure way**
We will be updating any updates from Uniswap repository as soon as we can.

**Anyway use at your own risk. This is a beta version** and we are still improving our mempool scanner, decoder, compute and predictions.

# Proposals

We are working hard to get this working. Trojan Finance is under active development.

- **Proposals to add tokens will be available soon.**

- **Proposals to add other dexes will be opened soon**
